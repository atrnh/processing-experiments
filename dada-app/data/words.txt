The way she stood looking at the picture. This stranger.
Suggested she wanted to be inside the picture.
The way I stood looking at the stranger. Suggested
I wanted to be inside her. Not the way you think
or only the way you think. But in her brain
inside the picture, a brain aware of being stared at
by herself being stared at by me. It's so simple: entire
lives go by day after day, an inch or arm's reach away.
One approach is to let them, another is to lash
ourselves together like boats or what else
gets lashed together? I don’t know, I should have majored
in lashing together at school. Instead I took classes
on Carl Jung and patrilineal and matrilineal societies
and ran naked in the rain around Northeast Grand Rapids
with a woman equally though differently naked.
Some people like to run around in the rain
with the same naked, I like to run around in the rain
with different naked, but I'd really like to know
if the artist felt the stranger staring at her picture.
And you? What matters to you? You who are staring at me
thinking of you. Slip me a note. Dance me a dance.
Say something in Spanish to a wind that will say something
in wind to me. Now that we're all friends. Now that the time
has come to leave.
